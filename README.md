## Naming issues

Format of these files is in one of the standard forms:

 * $colour-NAME:                      #HEXCODE;
 * $colour-NAME:                      rgb(Red,Green,Blue);
 * $colour-NAME:                      rgba(Red,Green,Blue,Alpha);


If you have a GREY/GRAY variant, ensure the alternative spelling points to the first version:

Example:

 *    $colour-grey-50:            #777;
 *    $colour-gray-50:            $colour-grey-50;
