## Naming issues

Format of these files is in one of the standard forms:

 * $colour-NAME:                      #HEXCODE;
 * $colour-NAME:                      rgb(Red,Green,Blue);
 * $colour-NAME:                      rgba(Red,Green,Blue,Alpha);

In the first instance, colours will use the UK/Australian English/French spelling for colour over the American English color.

If you have a GREY/GRAY variant, ensure the alternative spelling points to the first version:

Example:

 *    $colour-grey-50:            #777;
 *    $colour-gray-50:            $colour-grey-50;


To Do:
Colour mapping: $colour-* to $color- [$colour-black = $colour-black]
